Service monitoring using systemctl, convert string to number, RegEx
========================================================================
This document represents the following zabbix features/techniques:

* UserParameter which will discover all services. JSON format containing 2 parameters {#NAME} and {#STATUS}
* Item UserParameter with argument. A safest way (rather than use system.run) to call a custom command from item key
* A textual item. This is the input data (raw contet). A result from "systemctl status some-service-name". You do not want to store this in database
* A dependable item. By grabing the raw conted and using regular expression it is possible to extract a line. See item prototypes: "active {#NAME}" and "loaded {#NAME}".
  This technique show how it is possible to conver string to numbers. Underneath the hood it is not a substition.
